## 🗂️ File Organization Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each file has ONE clear purpose:
- **Learning** files are in `/SELF_EDUCATION/`
- **Demo** files are in `/DEMO_GUIDES/`
- **Templates** are in `/TEMPLATES/`
- **Product docs** are in root of `/BUSINESS_MATERIALS/`

### Clear Naming
- File names indicate purpose
- README files provide navigation
- INDEX files provide master navigation

### No Duplication
- Each piece of information lives in ONE place
- Cross-references instead of copying
- Outdated files are archived

---

## 📝 Note on Learning Logs

Files like `week_2_day_3.md` and `week_3_day_15_21.md` appear to be learning logs. Consider:
- **Archiving** if outdated (move to `/ARCHIVE/`)
- **Keeping** if still useful as reference
- **Updating** if they contain important information
