# ⚔️ DevOps Suite: Sales Battle Cards

## 🎯 Quick Scenarios

### 1. The Small Team (3-5 Devs)
**Pain:** "Works on my machine" costs $3k/dev/yr. Manual repetitive tasks. 58% of developers waste 5+ hours/week.
**Pitch:** "Pays for itself in 3 months. Saves $15k/yr for a 5-person team. Reclaim 5+ hours per week per developer."
**Key Tools:** Shell Games, Code Generator.

### 2. The Scaling Team (5-15 Devs) - The Breakpoint
**Pain:** Teams of 5-10 developers hit a "breakpoint" where process chaos kills velocity. Onboarding takes 4 days. Process chaos as team grows from 5 to 10.
**Pitch:** "78% faster onboarding. New hires productive in <1 day instead of 4. Standardized workflows prevent the breakpoint."
**Key Tools:** Git Workflows, Ubiquitous Automation, Shell Games.

### 3. The Tech Debt Team
**Pain:** Technical debt slowing 3-day features into 3-week slogs. Bugs keep appearing. Fear of refactoring.
**Pitch:** "Hotspot-first code quality & security analysis. Shows '10 hotspots to fix' instead of SonarQube's overwhelming '50,000 issues.' 18 rules with OWASP Top 10 coverage. Prevents 3-day features from becoming 3-week slogs by prioritizing actionable fixes."
**Key Tools:** Software Entropy, Ubiquitous Automation.

### 4. The "Wannabe DevOps" Team
**Pain:** Manual deployments. Inconsistent environments ("works on my machine" costs $3k/dev/year). Want an IDP but too small to build one. Manual infrastructure changes ("ClickOps").
**Pitch:** "Your Out-of-the-Box Internal Developer Platform for teams too small to build their own. 30% higher deployment frequency. 40% lower change failure rate. Infrastructure as code eliminates 'ClickOps' and ensures staging matches production."
**Key Tools:** Ubiquitous Automation, Shell Games, Infrastructure as Code.

## 🛡️ Objection Handling Cheat Sheet

**1. "We don't have time."**
👉 "Setup is <1 week. ROI on Day 1. Start with just Shell Games (2hrs setup)."

**2. "We already have some of this."**
👉 "Great. We don't replace; we complete. We fill the gaps in your CI/CD to make it production-grade."

**3. "Our team won't adopt it."**
👉 "Training is included. We've found resistance turns to enthusiasm once devs feel the time savings."

**4. "It's too expensive."**
👉 "Math: $3k/dev/yr savings vs $3,385/yr package cost ($997 + $199×12). 443% ROI (productivity) or 3,840% ROI (time) for 5-person team. Pays for itself in 3 months."

**5. "We'll build it ourselves."**
👉 "Maintenance is the hidden cost. We are ready now. Why spend weeks building what we've already tested?"
