## **Integration Best Practices** (From Real Production Projects)

### **Quick Setup Patterns**

**1. NPM Script Integration**
All tools are accessible via simple npm commands. Add these to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "check-env": "./scripts/dev-env-check.sh",
    "test:all": "./scripts/test-all.sh",
    "lint:test": "./scripts/lint-and-test.sh",
    "gen:route": "./scripts/code-generator.sh route",
    "quality:check": "./scripts/code-quality-check.sh",
    "git:status": "./scripts/git-workflow-helper.sh status",
    "git:pr": "./scripts/git-workflow-helper.sh pr"
  }
}
```

**2. Multi-Service Project Support**
All scripts automatically detect and handle:
- `frontend/` (React/Next.js)
- `backend/` (Node.js/Express)
- `automation/` (Python)
- Root level services

**3. CI/CD Ready**
All scripts work seamlessly in GitHub Actions and other CI environments:
- Non-interactive mode when `CI=true`
- Graceful failure for optional checks
- No manual intervention required

### **Proven ROI from Production Integration**
